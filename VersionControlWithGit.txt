Git is the best choice for most software teams today. While every team is different and should do their 
own analysis, here are the main reasons why version control with Git is preferred over alternatives:

+ Git is good

Git has the functionality, performance, 
security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need.
These attributes of Git are detailed above. In side-by-side comparisons with most
other alternatives, many teams find that Git is very favorable.

+Git is a quality open source project

Git is a very well supported open source project with over a decade of solid stewardship. 
The project maintainers have shown balanced judgment and a mature approach to meeting the 
long term needs of its users with regular releases that improve usability and functionality. 
The quality of the open source software is easily scrutinized and countless businesses rely 
heavily on that quality.

Git enjoys great community support and a vast user base. Documentation is excellent and plentiful, 
including books, tutorials and dedicated web sites. There are also podcasts and video tutorials.

Being open source lowers the cost for hobbyist developers as they can use Git without paying a fee. 
For use in open-source projects, Git is undoubtedly the successor to the previous generations of 
successful open source version control systems, SVN and CVS.
